          <figcaption>The Volvo XC60 sits right at the heart of the big-selling mid-size crossover crowd. It's 
            handsome and luxurious and it wraps you in a safety blanket as comprehensive as the Swedish 
            welfare state. It's not distracted by off-road ambitions. Neither is it wearing the pretence 
            of track lapping athlecticism.

        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p class="article__paragraph">This middle-of-the-road approach of course lands it some stern rivals. The Mercedes-Benz GLC and Audi Q5 
          are both right there, and both implacably copetent. But the Volvo feels very different inside. It's decor is as 
          Skandi as a Stockholm boutique hot bar.
        </p>
        <p class="article__paragraph">The generation-2 XC60 starts with a lot of momentum behind it. The old one wasn't only Volvo's best-selling 
          car, it was also the best-selling vehicle of that type in Europe. Its suspension manners might have been pretty 
          rough-and-ready but even that wasn't enough to hold the old car back.
